Energy Efficient AAC Block Manufacturing by Magicrete Building Solutions Pvt. Ltd (Navsari).

Magicrete Building Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Is engaged in the production of high-quality grade I Aerated
Autoclaved Concrete (herein after called as AAC) blocks as per IS 2185 Part 3 (Title : “CONCRETE
MASONRY UNITS – AUTOCLAVED CELLULAR (AERATED) CONCRETE BLOCKS”) and
products. Magicrete is India’s frontline producer of AAC blocks, wall panels, drymix Mortars &
precast construction solutions, founded in 2008.

Magicrete is a pioneer in green building materials, its
vision is to help people build their homes better cheaper & faster by using innovative construction
technologies. Magicrete has two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities which are located at Navsari,
near Surat on the Mumbai-Surat highway & in Jhajjar, Haryana near Gurgaon. Their plants are
strategically located close to thermal power plants which ensure a smooth supply of raw materials. The
plants are also within a 250 km radius of most urbanized regions of India like Delhi, Gurgaon in case of
Jhajjar plant and Mumbai, Pune, Nasik, Surat, Vadodara, Bharuch, Ahmedabad in case of Navsari
Plant.

The core of this technology is the AAC blocks composition and its chemistry, with fly ash from
thermal plants mixed with Lime, Cement, Gypsum and Aluminium powder, which enable the blocks to
acquire the mechanical properties required during the hydration and curing process without being
sintered.

The main goal of this project is to create a high-quality walling material and a well-insulating building
material by adopting an efficient, low-energy-intensive brick production process. This process aims to
replace the use of high-energy-intensive methods like Clay Brick Bull's trench kilns (BTKs) and make
a positive impact on energy consumption at both the brick production and building operation levels.
The project focuses on manufacturing Aerated Autoclaved Concrete (AAC) blocks, which offer
numerous advantages. These blocks have impressive compressive strength, are lightweight, easy to
construct, and economically viable for transportation. By employing this method as a substitute for
traditional bricks produced in kilns, which are CO2-intensive, the project proponent aims to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. By adopting this low-carbon technology, the project contributes to
decreasing emissions and promoting a cleaner environment.

While attaining the prime objective the project activity will also
a. Reduce GHG emissions associated to energy consumption (both fossil fuel and electricity) in the
high energy intensive BTKs by an energy efficient brick making technology.
b. Reduce air pollution by introducing robust air treatment facilities in the project activity; the clay
brick kiln technology is adopted by an unorganized sector with very poor air treatment facilities;
c. Enhance use of fly ash, an industrial -waste, as a major ingredient of building material.

AMS-III.Z.. (Title: “Fuel Switch, process improvement and energy
efficiency in brick manufacture”, Version 06.0)
Production process of AAC blocks does not involve sintering or kiln heating for blocks consolidation
and thus eliminates the burning of fossil fuels as required in the clay brick production ultimately
contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The estimated annual average and the total
CO2e emission reduction by the project activity over the crediting period of 9 years are expected to
be1,23,705 tCO2e.
